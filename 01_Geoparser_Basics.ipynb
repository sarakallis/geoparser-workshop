    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to help you explore and interact with the Geoparser library. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid understanding of how to use Geoparser for basic geoparsing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to initialize and use Geoparser.\n",
    "- Perform geoparsing on text strings and documents.\n",
    "- Access and analyze geoparsing results.\n",
    "- Visualize locations on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ“– **Documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires you to consult the Geoparser documentation: [docs.geoparser.app](https://docs.geoparser.app). Knowing where to find information about the library is crucial for working with it effectively, especially as it is likely that future updates may bring changes to functionality. The documentation will always be the definitive reference for how to use the package.\n",

    "### 1.1 Initialize Geoparser <a name=\"task-initialize-geoparser\"></a>\n",

    "**Objective:** Initialize the Geoparser so that it's ready to parse text.\n",

    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import the necessary class to use Geoparser.\n",
    "- Initialize an instance of the `Geoparser` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Geoparser uses the following configuration:\n",

    "These defaults prioritize speed over accuracy and are optimized for English texts. If you require higher accuracy and donâ€™t mind increased computational cost, or need to process texts in other languages, you can specify different models as shown in the Advanced Usage section.\n"
